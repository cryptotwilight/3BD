Welcome to 3 Blind Deeds a new way to borrow against your onchain assets without revealing your assets preserving your privacy.

This protocol enables you to create an onchain deed which can be collateralised on chain without revealing the assets held by the deed.

**so what?**
So this now means you can now borrow against your one of one NFT without revealing to lenders that you're borrowing against something of significance and more importantly without revealing who you are.
